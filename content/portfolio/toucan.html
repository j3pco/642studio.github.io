    The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toucan-language-learning/id1562755912">Toucan iOS Client</a> and CI/CD
    delivery for Apple Platforms. Done in collaboration with <a
        href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-mobile-team-llc/">The Mobile Team</a>.
    For this effort we refactored the existing Mac client code base into a universal application that would also run on
    iOS as well as setting up a CI/CD system to deliver application releases integrating existing tooling and workflows
    the <a href="https://jointoucan.com">Toucan</a> team had already setup.
